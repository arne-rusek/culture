# Household manners

This section covers some suggestions that are considered good household manners. 

## Cultural sensitivities
We are spread across geographies and different cultures. 
- We will use open channels for communication as much as possible to keep the conversations transparent.
- In case there are direct discussions between two individuals, the relevant content will be diligently documented and posted on Slack for everyone's benefit.
- Each of us will remain sensitive to make comments about an individual’s ignorance in the meetings and slack channels. No questions are stupid.
- Similarly, some cultures are more direct and candid than others.  We strive to be as candid as possible - while remembering people first.  Giving direct feedback is more kind than hiding one's opinion not just for that person but for all the other team members.  We are all depending on each other learning fast and no one is perfect.  

## Online meetings (voice or video)
- On-time, there is always a ramp-up time due to unforeseen reboots which we all have which is fine
- Be prepared, find a calm place, with as little background noise as possible
- Don’t eat during the call the crispy sounds can be heard better than you think!
- Mute yourself, there’s a mute button for a reason. It might not seem like it, but there’s a lot of background noise even in the quietest of offices. There may also be feedback you can’t hear, but everyone else can. Unless you’re speaking, keep your phone on mute. However, don’t use this feature as an excuse to sneak a snack. Refer back to the last point for a reminder.
- Make sure to say goodbye, and do so with a smile
- When group calling, don't use a cell phone on speaker, they are not sufficient
- If you must use for whatever reason (did you prepare?) make sure that it does not vibrate

## In-person meetings / Online meetings
- Plan to attend on time, others are waiting for you
- Meetings are scheduled to discuss openly with an expected outcome of clearing doubts if there are any. Ask your doubts in the meeting. A meeting is not successful if you had a doubt before the meeting, and it continues to exist after meeting because you did not bring it up
- Avoid one-on-one chats in the meeting. 
- Feel free to share information. Make it short, precise and relevant to the meeting agenda. Try not to interrupt a team member when they are speaking.

## Say thank you on Slack especially
- We don't spend much time together in person as a team.  This introduces the risk that misunderstandings can be amplified over time.  Therefore we go out of our way to thank each other for their comments even if we disagree with them or do not yet fully understand them.
- When we read something that resonates or is helpful on Slack we make an effort to take an extra second or two to give a thumbs up or to say thank you.  Especially for remote workers this kind of interaction can provide useful feedback.

# Slack etiquette

This part is heavily inspired by [Slack blog](https://slack.com/intl/en-us/blog) and [GitLab Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#slackbots).

## What is it good for

- treat as non-urgent often asynchronous depending on timezone
	- use phone
- team chats should be exception
- quick sync

## What doesn't work that much

- Expect people might not notice your message
	- Slack tends to be high traffic and our especially.
	- Ephemeral
	- GitLab keeps only 90 days of Slack history for this reason. It is good to keep in mind that even with fulltext search it might be hard to find particular discussions again. Especially if they don't align with our Slack etiquette.

## Etiquette tips in Slack

Slack documentation has this mostly figured out. Rather than copy-pasting it here, **please read** [Etiquette tips in Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-us/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack).

Outline:

1. Fewer messages means fewer notifications
2. Write longer messages that scan quickly
3. Use threads. Seriously.
4. Replace short follow-up messages with emoji reactions
5. Reduce off-hours pings with Do Not Disturb
6. Set response expectations at the channel level
7. Default to public channels

## Dos and Don'ts

WIP aka how we want to align or where we might be missing a bit of our Slack etiquette and [PLOW](../plow.md) in general.

Make sure you align with [PLOW](../plow.md) culture in your day to day Slack interactions.

- Respect others and their time
	- give links
	- gather information
	- use long messages
	- use threads
- Assume positive intent
- Be kind
- Jump on an ad-hoc call if you feel discussion is getting nowhere slowly.
	- And share notes or summarize the result.
	- This especially saves a lot of time and anguish.
- Help others
- Use mostly public channels
- Negative feedback is 1-1
- Say thanks in #say-thanks channel
- [Feel free to contribute](../plow.md#speakup) - everyone is a moderator, help others learn (not only slack etiquette :grin:)
	- And prepare [Own your communication](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/So_you%27ve_made_a_mistake_and_it%27s_public...) :sweat_smile:
- [Be kind to contributors](../plow.md#be-a-mentor), try to be more accepting of people taking initiative in trying to improve things. Make sure you communicate on slack in a way that not only allows contributions but is inviting.
	- Oh yes, those threads again. Allow others to contribute or follow discussions easily.
	- In case you had a meeting regarding a topic share notes or summarize it.
- Do edit first messages of thread later if it sparks deeper discussion to inform others
- Do go back to existing threads if you have something to add
- Do not spam people (too much) with notifications. It creates distractions and also FOMO thus bringing down productivity
	- If you spread your discussions between many messages/threads or even channels it is very hard to follow.
	- Consider creating a google doc/sheet/folder on a team drive or Jira issue gathering all the info for others.

## More slack best practices

- use integrations, do not spam communication channels
- connect google calendar
- use slack status
- expect asynchronous responses
	- it is hard to see that person you're contacting might be doing something else or is involved in many more discussions already
	- do not start messages with "hey" or "hello", write the whole message
	- give people time to react
- set notifications on non-urgent/high-traffic channels to lower setting (mention/never) and read them in a batch (e.g. #til, #fun)
- Do not announce vacation in slack
	- Create "OOO" event either full day(s) or shorter and invite your manager.
	- Use slack status :vacation: with node saying when you're on vacation.
	- This will allow all to see what you're up to when they need it.

## Tips and Tricks

- CTRL+K
- Subscribe to existing thread by adding emoji reaction or just clicking thread menu and selecting "Follow thread".
- Use remind me, save
- Archive old channels
- Arrow UP

## Maintenance

- Use pinning - but keep it well maintained. There's nothing that missing information, maybe only misleading or outdated one.
- **TODO** AutoArchive Bot
- **TODO** Groups-as-a-code? Channels-as-a-code?
- Keep this alive, contribute!
	- This document should be a useful guideline on how to win in the company
	- Discuss questions comments or complaints(!) in #plow or #plow-slack
	- Create PRs against this repository :heart:
